## Stakeholder Needs

| ID | Stakeholder Need |
|:---|:---|
| UN-GIT-01 | A student developer needs a way to start tracking a local project because it has no recorded history. |
| UN-GIT-02 | A student developer needs to know which project files have changed because they may forget what they edited before recording a checkpoint. |
| UN-GIT-03 | A student developer needs to inspect changed content before recording it because a file may contain unintended edits. |
| UN-GIT-04 | A student developer needs to choose the file content to include in the next checkpoint because some current changes may still be unfinished. |
| UN-GIT-05 | A student developer needs to record a meaningful checkpoint because they want to record an important project version and provide a descriptive label. |
| UN-GIT-06 | A student developer needs to review earlier checkpoints because they want to understand how the project reached its current state. |
| UN-GIT-07 | A student developer needs invalid commands to explain why they failed while preserving existing project files and recorded checkpoints. |
